-- Fails if any file in S3 raw/ breaks the naming rule.
-- "Newest file wins" orders by file name, so the name must carry the
-- extract date and a sequence number:  <feed>_<YYYYMMDD>_<n>.csv
-- The three original full extracts (stores.csv, department.csv, fact.csv) are allowed.
-- This also catches files the pipes would silently ignore (e.g. Department_Oct.csv).
